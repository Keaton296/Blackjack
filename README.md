## The Design
The OOP design of the project has been tried to be made similar with Unity's API, though it is nowhere near of Unity's API.<br>
E.g. There are GameObject,Scene and MonoBehaviour classes inside the project. <br>
The project is documented with comments, feel free to inspect/recommend anything.
